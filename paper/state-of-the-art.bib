    abstract = { Computational grids process large, computationally intensive problems on small data sets. In contrast, data grids process large computational problems that in turn require evaluating, mining and producing large amounts of data. Replication, creating geographically disparate identical copies of data, is regarded as one of the major optimization techniques for reducing data access costs. In this paper, several replication algorithms are discussed. These algorithms were studied using the Grid simulator: OptorSim. OptorSim provides a modular framework within which optimization strategies can be studied under different Grid configurations. The goal is to explore the stability and transient behaviour of selected optimization techniques. We detail the design and implementation of OptorSim and analyze various replication algorithms based on different Grid workloads. }

abstract="Data Grids seek to harness geographically distributed resources for large-scale data-intensive problems. Such problems, involving loosely coupled jobs and large data-sets, are found in fields like high-energy physics, astronomy and bioinformatics. A variety of factors need to be considered for effective scheduling of resources in such environments: e.g., resource utilization, response time, global and local allocation policies and scalability. We propose a general and extensible scheduling architecture that addresses these issues. Within this architecture we develop a suite of job scheduling and data replication algorithms that we evaluate using simulations for a wide range of parameters. Our results show that it is important to evaluate the combined effectiveness of replication and scheduling strategies, rather than study them separately. More specifically, we find that scheduling jobs to locations that contain the data they need and asynchronously replicating popular data-sets to remote sites, works rather well.",
