    abstract = { Computational grids process large, computationally intensive problems on small data sets. In contrast, data grids process large computational problems that in turn require evaluating, mining and producing large amounts of data. Replication, creating geographically disparate identical copies of data, is regarded as one of the major optimization techniques for reducing data access costs. In this paper, several replication algorithms are discussed. These algorithms were studied using the Grid simulator: OptorSim. OptorSim provides a modular framework within which optimization strategies can be studied under different Grid configurations. The goal is to explore the stability and transient behaviour of selected optimization techniques. We detail the design and implementation of OptorSim and analyze various replication algorithms based on different Grid workloads. }

abstract="Data Grids seek to harness geographically distributed resources for large-scale data-intensive problems. Such problems, involving loosely coupled jobs and large data-sets, are found in fields like high-energy physics, astronomy and bioinformatics. A variety of factors need to be considered for effective scheduling of resources in such environments: e.g., resource utilization, response time, global and local allocation policies and scalability. We propose a general and extensible scheduling architecture that addresses these issues. Within this architecture we develop a suite of job scheduling and data replication algorithms that we evaluate using simulations for a wide range of parameters. Our results show that it is important to evaluate the combined effectiveness of replication and scheduling strategies, rather than study them separately. More specifically, we find that scheduling jobs to locations that contain the data they need and asynchronously replicating popular data-sets to remote sites, works rather well.",

  abstract={The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid project (WLCG) provides the computing and storage resources required by the LHC collaborations to store, process and analyse the 50 Petabytes of data annually generated by the LHC. The WLCG operations are coordinated by a distributed team of managers and experts and performed by people at all participating sites and from all the experiments. Several improvements in the WLCG infrastructure have been implemented during the first long LHC shutdown to prepare for the increasing needs of the experiments during Run2 and beyond. However, constraints in funding will affect not only the computing resources but also the available effort for operations. This paper presents the results of a detailed investigation on the allocation of the effort in the different areas of WLCG operations, identifies the most important sources of inefficiency and proposes viable strategies for optimising the operational cost, taking into account the current trends in the evolution of the computing infrastructure and the computing models of the experiments.}

In this review, I discuss the rationale for the design of a distributed system and describe how this environment was constructed and deployed through the use of grid computing technologies. I discuss the experience with large-scale testing and operation with real accelerator data, which shows that expectations have been met and sometimes exceeded. The computing system's key achievements are that (a) the WLCG infrastructure is distributed and makes use of all the dispersed resources, (b) the experiments' computing models are also distributed and can make excellent use of the infrastructure, and (c) the computing system has enabled physics output in a very short time. Finally, I present prospects for the future evolution of the WLCG infrastructure. }
